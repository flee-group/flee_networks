# FLEE River Networks
This repo holds the code to delineate networks studied by the FLEE group. Each network is organized as a submodule; each network can be cloned individually. To get them all:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/flee-group/flee_networks.git
    
Additionally, binary files of the delineated river networks are available under the releases tab for the individual network repositories.

This repo itself holds the code to process and visualise the different networks, viewable on the [repository page](https://flee-group.github.io/flee_networks).

## Data availability

Most data for this module is publicly available, but is kept out of this repository due to the size. Contact the maintainers for access to the exact files.
